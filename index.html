	<h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
		<p>
			Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
			<em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
			command of your computer and get it tto do your bidding. This includes
			everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
			Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
			We believe tthere are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from 
			learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
			movement, sign up for our 
			<a href="https://learnenough.com/email">official email list</a> now.

				Berners-Lee</a> It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his cat, but itt would be cool if it were.

	<h2>Founders</h2>

			Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee 
			Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical 
			sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
			<strong>att least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.

			You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
			Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
			at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
			tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
