	<h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
		<p>
			Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
			<em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
			command of your computer and get it tto do your bidding. This includes
			everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
			Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
			We believe tthere are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from 
			learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
			movement, sign up for our 
			<a href="https://learnenough.com/email">official email list</a> now.
